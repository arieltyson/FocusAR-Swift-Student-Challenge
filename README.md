## What‚Äôs New ‚ú®
<div align="left">

### Voice-Activated Mindfulness Sessions
- **Siri + App Intents:** Start/end sessions hands-free with Shortcuts phrases (e.g., ‚ÄúStart a focus session in FocusAR‚Äù).
- **Deep Links:** App Intents open the app via a custom URL scheme to pass parameters:
  - `focusar://start?minutes=10&mode=calming`
  - `focusar://end`
- **In-Session Voice Controls:** On-device speech recognition plus **Foundation Models** classification maps phrases ‚Üí actions:
  - ‚ÄúEnd session‚Äù ‚Üí exits session
  - ‚ÄúMute / Unmute‚Äù ‚Üí toggles calming audio
- **Private by design:** Speech transcription and intent classification run **on device**.

### Open-Ended Sessions
- Sessions are no longer time-boxed. A subtle timer and a prominent **End** button give you control.

### Award-Oriented UX
- Refined onboarding that clearly explains AR guidance, voice control, privacy, and accessibility.
- A focused **Home** screen that centers the experience, with tasteful animations (optional Lottie confetti on session end).

## Features

- **Mindful AR Guidance:** Tap identified ‚Äúbusy‚Äù areas in your environment to receive calming cues (haptics + sound).
- **On-Device Intelligence:** 
  - **Speech** (SFSpeechRecognizer) for transcription
  - **Foundation Models (iOS 18+)** for intent classification (end/mute/unmute)
- **Hands-Free Control with Siri:** App Intents + Shortcuts launch sessions and pass parameters.
- **Accessibility & Inclusivity:** Dynamic Type, VoiceOver labels, Reduce Motion fallbacks, safe-area-aware HUD.
- **Privacy:** No camera frames or audio leave your device.
